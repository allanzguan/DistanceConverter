### Distance Converter
---
Simple android app allow the user to select either Miles-to-Kilometers or Kilometers-to-Miles
conversions. Conversion is selected using Radio Buttons. Miles-to-Kilometers should be the default
if there is no saved preference.

- The distance value (the value to be converted) should be entered by the user. Values can be
positive or negative. Only numeric whole or decimal values should be allowed.

- Pressing the Convert button should clear the input field, generate the converted distance value and
display it on the screen. All converted values will be displayed out to 1 decimal place only.

- All conversion operations and their results will be added to the “history” – a list of converted
values. The history of converted values is scrollable and displayed with the most recent
conversions at the top of the list.

- Pressing the “Clear” button will clear the conversion history.

- Landscape layout is available.
